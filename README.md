The entry test of the drone club of my collegerequired us to make a frame extracter which extracts the frames from the video uploaded

Design a user interface (UI) for video frame extraction and display. Design and build a Web-Based User Interface with a Python backend such that it has the following features:

Features:
Allow users to upload a video file.
Extract the frames of the uploaded video.
Display the extracted frames in a structured and organized layout on the UI.
Include a command bar for navigation and control, with buttons for:
 Play
 Pause
 Skip (forward)
 Export frames
Dynamically display the frames as they are processed.
Add code to initialise the UI, handle video uploads, extract frames from the video, and update the UI with the frames in real-time.
Ensure the UI is visually appealing through styling.
